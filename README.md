• Orchestrated the construction of a C++ SDK for DaisySeed, facilitating real-time
audio manipulation; averaged 100+ downloads monthly, making the project the
most downloaded on organization’s Github.

• Designed a framework to leverage DaisySeed’s DSP for effects, synthesis, and rout-
ing.

• Contributed to an open-source project focused on processing and manipulating
audio signals using advanced signal processing techniques.

• Designed hardware circuits for booting and controlling the DaisySeed platform for
embedded audio applications.

• Created the necessary circuits and schematics for powering up and interfacing
with the DaisySeed hardware.

• Created PCB designs and embedded programming for controlling DaisySeed’s au-
dio processing capabilities.
